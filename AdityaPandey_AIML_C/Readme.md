Gradient Descent Linear Regression in Python

In this code, we'll implement a simple linear regression using gradient descent. We'll fit a line to a univariate dataset, optimize the line's parameters (slope and intercept), and make predictions.

Step-1: Upload CSV file to Google Drive

Step-2: Mount the Drive to Collab

Step-3: Import the csv path to Collab Notebook

Step-4: Read the CSV file

Step-5: Separate data into X and Y lists

Step-6: Importing the Matplotlib library

Step-7: Scatter plot the data

Step-8: Define function and implement for Cost function

Step-9: Define function and implement for Gradient Descent

Step-10: Define function and implement for Training function

Step-11: Define function and implement for Prediction function

Step-12: Train the Model and make the Prediction

By following these steps, you've learned how to use a mathematical technique called gradient descent to create a predictive model for real-world data. This process allows you to find the best-fitting straight line that can help you make predictions and gain insights from your data.
